# Design System: Consumit

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "Cinema After Midnight"**

Consumit feels cinematic, editorial, and human: a near-black room lit by warm ivory type and rare signals of color. The interface is intimate rather than glossy, with enough quiet space for artwork, taste, and other people’s perspectives to carry emotional weight.

The system pairs decisive controls with restrained surfaces. It should feel alive with other people’s taste without becoming noisy, gamified, or generically “streaming app.” Generic dashboards and glossy-tech decoration are explicit anti-references.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Near-black, flat surfaces with warm editorial contrast
- Charter display type paired with compact DejaVu Sans controls
- Square-to-gently-rounded geometry and warm-white hairlines
- Rare orange action signals with semantically reserved lilac and lime
- Purposeful composition that becomes distinct on mobile

## Colors

The palette is a midnight neutral field with warm ivory content and three deliberately scarce signals.

### Primary

- **Signal Orange:** Brand marks, committed actions, active routes, ratings, and progress.

### Secondary

- **Social Lilac:** Taste overlap and social context only.

### Tertiary

- **Positive Lime:** Presence, health, success, and availability only.
- **Quiet Danger:** Destructive actions without alarmist saturation.

### Neutral

- **Midnight Canvas:** The application background.
- **Navigation Black:** Stable global-shell background.
- **Quiet Surface / Raised Surface:** Tonal panel separation and selected states.
- **Warm Ink / Copy / Muted / Faint:** A descending hierarchy from primary content to low-emphasis decoration.
- **Separator / Control Outline:** Separators stay subtle; interactive boundaries remain independently perceptible.

### Named Rules

**The Scarce Signal Rule.** Orange communicates brand, selection, progress, or commitment; it is never ambient decoration.

**The Semantic Accent Rule.** Lilac means social or taste context, and lime means presence, health, or success. Do not swap their jobs for variety.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Charter with Bitstream Charter and Georgia fallbacks

**Body Font:** DejaVu Sans with Arial fallback

**Character:** Charter brings film-poster warmth and editorial authority. DejaVu Sans keeps navigation, controls, and metadata compact and direct. Both shipped webfonts are self-hosted.

### Hierarchy

- **Display:** Regular, tightly tracked, and near-solid leading for hero statements and major page titles.
- **Headline:** Regular Charter for section openings and card-led editorial statements.
- **Body:** Regular DejaVu Sans with generous leading and a readable maximum line length around 68 characters.
- **Label:** Compact uppercase DejaVu Sans with wide tracking for roles, categories, and state names.
- **Control:** Medium-weight DejaVu Sans with tight leading and subtle negative tracking for direct actions.

### Named Rules

**The Two Voices Rule.** Serif type tells the story; sans-serif type helps the member act.

## Layout

Desktop compositions use a 62px content edge and an 84px global navigation shell. The base unit is 4px, with the established rhythm progressing through 8, 12, 18, 24, 32, 48, and 64px. Broad editorial openings transition into structured content, often with a main column and a decision-oriented side rail.

The current catalog responds at 640px and 1024px. Mobile is composed independently rather than produced by shrinking a desktop grid; controls wrap, section ownership remains obvious, and primary actions retain touch-safe height.

## Elevation & Depth

The interface is flat by default. Depth comes from tonal surfaces, hairline boundaries, artwork gradients, and occasional cinematic imagery—not routine control or panel shadows.

**The Flat Interface Rule.** Shadows may separate artwork, but ordinary controls and content panels remain flat.

## Shapes

Controls and panels are square to gently rounded, using a tight 4–8px range. The 6px control radius is the default interactive shape. Circles are reserved for people, presence, progress, and the recurring celestial artwork language.

## Components

### Buttons

Buttons are compact, direct, and consequence-aware.

- **Shape:** Gently squared controls with a 6px radius; default and icon controls are 44px tall.
- **Primary:** Warm ivory fill with midnight text for the confident immediate action, such as Play or View.
- **Accent:** Signal-orange fill for committed flow progression, such as Create, Continue, or Submit.
- **Secondary:** Transparent fill with a dedicated accessible control outline; never reuse the faint separator as its boundary.
- **Ghost:** Transparent, low-emphasis destinations that gain a tonal surface on hover.
- **Danger:** Muted destructive fill with warm-ivory text.
- **Hover / Active:** Short 150ms color or brightness transitions; disabled actions use reduced opacity and no pointer affordance.
- **Focus:** A two-pixel signal-orange ring with a canvas offset remains visible on every variant.
- **Loading:** Preserve the label, prepend a spinning status glyph, expose `aria-busy`, and block repeat activation. Respect reduced-motion preferences.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** use the supplied brand and artwork assets instead of recreating them with generic icons.
- **Do** reserve ivory for confident immediate actions and orange for committed progression.
- **Do** preserve visible keyboard focus, touch-safe control heights, and readable metadata contrast.
- **Do** finish each shared component and its states before composing the next screen.

### Don't:

- **Don't** introduce large pills, routine gradients, glass effects, or floating dashboard cards.
- **Don't** use orange, lilac, or lime as interchangeable decoration.
- **Don't** reduce every surface to a rounded card grid.
- **Don't** treat mobile as a scaled-down desktop composition.
